I was born in Tucson, Arizona on July 21, 2000 before eventually moving to Mesa, AZ about a decade later. Both my parents were born in Nigeria but my mom moved to New York when she was 5 and my dad upon completing his undergradaute education in Nigeria. I have 3 younger siblings that are just as lovely as they are loud, something they got from me withou a doubt.

I have enjoyed making all sorts of things since I was young, starting off with making little biomes in playgrounds and parks, to Lego Stars Wars spaceships, to fantasy stories, and mini solar-powered cars. It was always such a joy whenever we'd get some new funriture or gadgets in a big box, because I knew that I would have fun with the next few hours assembling it.

I have enjoyed the idea of making new realities and altering the way people perceive the world since I saw an episode of Brain Games on National Geographic during a high school class. This, along with my incredible teachers, inspired me to pursue neuroscience as my area of undergraduate study at UChicago. I was quickly introduced to a wealth of incredible work here being done on human-centered engineering and quickly wanted to learn more about neural engineering and signal processing, human-computer interaction, and creative computation all around and between these topics.
