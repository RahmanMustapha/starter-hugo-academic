summary: >-
  I performed a series of tests and analyses of neural data in mice using the
  Allen Intstitute Brain Observatory and Software Development Kit. 


  Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks,  I made tuning curves, statistical bootstraps, and other analyses of suppressed-by-visual-contrast neurons in visual cortex in response to drifting gratings stimuli. 


  I then compiled the information into a dataframe comparing neural responses in different visual regions and across different genetic cre lines.

   I worked under Dr. Daniel Millman following his research (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33108272) and Dr. Saskia de Vries at the Allen Institue.
