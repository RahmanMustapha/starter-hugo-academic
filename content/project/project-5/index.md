summary: >-
  Consists of components of several VR porjects I made using javascript and
  field in a VR production course. The capsone project combined three of my
  passions in computer-generated music, colorful and algorithmic 3D art, and
  electrical muscle stimulation to make a visualizer in VR in which touching the
  virtual "knobs" would elicit electrical shocks to the arms. This mulitsensory
  experience allows users to experience the digital facilitation of visual,
  auditory, and tactile senses simultaneously in a non-conventional manner.
